## Business Problem
The project aims to identify the factors affecting Arabica coffee quality by analyzing a comprehensive dataset provided by CQI. By understanding these factors, the project seeks to improve coffee quality standards and support the development of the specialty coffee industry.

## Tools Used
- **Microsoft Power BI Desktop**: For data visualization and dashboard creation.
- **Google Sheets**: For data translation and preparation.
- **Power Query**: For data cleaning and transformation.

## Dataset
The dataset includes detailed information on coffee production, processing, and sensory evaluations and other influential factors. It contains **207 rows and 31 columns**.

## Data Cleaning and Preparation
Several steps were taken to clean and prepare the data, including:
- Removing irrelevant columns
- Removing blanks and duplicates
- Translating non-English text
- Creating **Calculated columns** such as Total Defects, Coffee Cupping, and Moisture Range
- Creating **Calculated measures** such as Total Variety, and Moisture Percentage

## Insights
Key findings from the analysis include:
- **Taiwan Coffee Laboratory** is the top-performing partner in enhancing coffee quality.
- **Pulped Natural/Honey** is the recommended processing method for better coffee quality.
- Maintaining **Moisture content between 9-12%** is crucial for high-quality coffee.
- **Yellow beans** are recommended to obtain good quality beans.
- **Defects** in coffee are inversely proportional to its quality.

## Recommendations
- **Focus on Quality Control**: Implement strict quality control to minimize defects.
- **Collaborate with Experts**: Strengthen partnerships with leading coffee laboratories.
- **Optimize Processing Methods**: Prioritize the Pulped Natural/Honey method for better results.
- **Monitor Moisture Content**: Ensure coffee beans maintain optimal moisture levels.
- **Quality Yellow Coffee Beans**: Source and select yellow coffee beans, for getting best flavors and ensuring a better starting point for production.
- **Invest in Training**: Provide training and resources to coffee producers for better quality control.

## Visualization
The project includes a comprehensive dashboard created in **Power BI**, highlighting key insights and recommendations. 

## Conclusion
This project provides a detailed analysis of the factors affecting Arabica coffee quality and offers practical recommendations for improving coffee standards. By leveraging data-driven insights, stakeholders can enhance coffee production processes and ultimately deliver a superior product to the market.
